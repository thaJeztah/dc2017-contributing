## Issue triage


## Issue triage

- What _is_ triage?
- What procedures do we follow? [issue-triage](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/project/ISSUE-TRIAGE.md)


## What is triage?

- Get the right information
- Find duplicates
- Label issues to make them easier to find
- TL;DR in many cases "adding metadata"


## What procedures do we follow?

- Procedures for issue-triage are described in [issue-triage.md](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/project/ISSUE-TRIAGE.md)
- Meet our bots! [Poule](https://github.com/icecrime/poule) and [Leeroy](https://github.com/docker/leeroy) (both AKA [@GordonTheTurtle](https://github.com/gordontheturtle))


## How to get started?

- Any time!  
  Being a curator starts with "being" one (just like any maintainer)
- Subscribe to the GitHub repository
  - check new issues, and new comments
  - (warning: be prepared to get spammed)
- Go through old issues; see if they need to be followed up
  - issues labeled `status/more-info-needed`


## Examples

- The GitHub issue tracker is not for "support" questions (see our [issue template](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/moby/moby/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE.md)). If a user arrives on GitHub with a question,
  that's clearly not a "bug" or "feature request";
  - If possible, give some hints, or refer to the correct [location in the documentation](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/29817#issuecomment-269947478).
  - Point the user to the preferred channels for other type of questions
<br><br>
It generally helps to provide some pointers; perhaps the user's question
is already answered by your reply, and other users arriving on the issue
may benefit from that.


## Examples (2)

- Issues sometimes get opened by mistake [fun fun, GitHub keyboard shortcuts](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/29812)
  - Leave a note, and close
  - Try to always communicate why you performed an action. It helps reduce "noise" ("why was this closed?")
- Issues can start living a life on their own. Multiple issues start
  to pile up, and there is no clear resolution
  - Summarize the situation, and provide follow up steps for users
    that arrive at the issue (e.g., through Google), after that,
    [lock the issue](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/1295#issuecomment-269058662)
  - Generally, we try to avoid locking, but sometimes it helps


## Examples (3)

Check if issues are opened in the right issue tracker. It's easy to
be confused, so help users find the right location, for example:

-  Docker for Mac https://github.com/docker/for-mac/issues
-  Docker for Windows https://github.com/docker/for-win/issues
-  Docker Swarm https://github.com/docker/swarm/issues


## Examples (4)

Getting the right information is important. For example, the output
of `docker version` and `docker info` can provide information about
the _kernel_ someone is running on, and if they're running the official
packages, or a version that's built by [a third party](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/26862).

- Check if the kernel version matches what's expected (e.g. on RHEL/CentOS, kernel 3.10.x is expected, other versions can result in issues)
- It may be worth asking if they modified their `systemd` unit files
- Logs and reproduction steps are always useful

These steps can be time consuming, and the end result may be that it's
"not a bug"


## Feature requests

There's many ways people use Docker, and we receive a lot of feature
requests.

- Does the feature request benefit just a narrow use case?
- Is it consistent with other features?
- Is it actually something that should be part of Docker's core functionality?
- Look for _use cases_, not _solutions_
