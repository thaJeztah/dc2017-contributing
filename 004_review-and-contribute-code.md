## Code review and contributing


## Code review


## What procedures do we follow?

- Code review process described in [REVIEWING.md](https://github.com/moby/moby/blob/master/project/REVIEWING.md)
- Meet our bots! [Poule](https://github.com/icecrime/poule) and [Leeroy](https://github.com/docker/leeroy) (both AKA [@GordonTheTurtle](https://github.com/gordontheturtle))


## Who can do code review?

- Anyone! Not just maintainers reviewing code
- Follow the review process to get a "feel" of the process
- Don't like a change? Let yourself be heard!
- Participate! More eyes is better code :-)
